Create a GitHub Repository: Go to GitHub and create a new repository by clicking on the "+" sign in the top right corner and selecting "New repository". Name your repository appropriately, for example, "module2-solution".
Push Your Solution Code: After creating the repository, clone it to your local machine using Git. Then, add your solution code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files) to this repository.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/module2-solution.git
cd module2-solution
Enable GitHub Pages: Once your solution code is in the repository, go to the "Settings" tab of your repository on GitHub. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
In the "Source" dropdown menu, select "main" or "master" branch, depending on which branch contains your solution code.
Choose the root folder as the source. This will ensure that GitHub Pages serves your solution files from the root directory.
Click "Save" or "Save Changes" to enable GitHub Pages for your repository.
Access Your GitHub Pages URL: After enabling GitHub Pages, GitHub will provide you with a URL where your solution is hosted. It will be something like: http://yourusername.github.io/module2-solution.
Test the URL: Before submitting your assignment, make sure to test the URL provided by GitHub to ensure your solution webpage displays correctly.
That's it! You now have a GitHub Pages URL pointing to your solution for the assignment. You can use this URL for your assignment submission.
