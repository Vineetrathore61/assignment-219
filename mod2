Creating a GitHub Pages site involves a few steps, but it's relatively straightforward. Here's a comprehensive guide:

GitHub Repository Setup:
Ensure your assignment solution is organized within a GitHub repository. If it's not already, create a new repository for your assignment on GitHub.
Branch Selection:
Decide which branch of your repository you want to publish as your GitHub Pages site. Typically, the main branch is used for this purpose.
Enable GitHub Pages:
Go to your repository's settings on GitHub.
Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
Under "Source", select the branch you want to publish (e.g., main).
Optionally, you can choose a folder within that branch if your solution is not at the root level.
Save your changes.
Wait for Deployment:
GitHub will build and deploy your site. This process may take a few moments. You'll see a message indicating when your site is ready.
Access Your Site:
Once deployed, your site will be accessible at a URL based on your GitHub username and repository name. It will typically be in the format http://yourGitHubUsername.github.io/yourRepositoryName.
If you've chosen a specific folder within your repository, the URL might include that folder's name as well.
Verify the URL:
Open a web browser and navigate to the URL of your GitHub Pages site to ensure it's displaying your assignment solution correctly.
Test Interactivity (if applicable):
If your assignment includes interactive elements (like JavaScript), make sure they work as intended on your GitHub Pages site.
Submission:
Once you've confirmed that your solution is visible at the provided URL and is functioning correctly, you can submit the URL as your assignment solution.
