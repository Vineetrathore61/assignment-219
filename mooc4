GitHub Repository Setup:
Make sure your assignment solution is organized within a GitHub repository. If it's not already, create a new repository for your assignment on GitHub.
GitHub Pages Configuration:
Go to your repository's settings on GitHub.
Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
Under "Source", select the branch and folder (if applicable) containing your assignment solution.
Save your changes.
Wait for Deployment:
GitHub will build and deploy your site. This process may take a few moments. You'll see a message indicating when your site is ready.
Access Your Site:
Once deployed, your site will be accessible at a URL based on your GitHub username and repository name. It will typically be in the format http://yourGitHubUsername.github.io/yourRepositoryName.
If you've chosen a specific folder within your repository, the URL might include that folder's name as well.
Verification:
Open a web browser and navigate to the URL of your GitHub Pages site to ensure it's displaying your assignment solution correctly.
Testing:
Verify that any interactive elements (if present) are functioning correctly on your GitHub Pages site.
Submission:
Once you've confirmed that your solution is visible at the provided URL and is functioning correctly, you can submit the URL as your assignment solution.
